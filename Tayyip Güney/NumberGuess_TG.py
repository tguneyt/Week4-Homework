# Number Guessing Game
# General Information:
# I want to play a game which I can guess a number. 
# The computer chooses a number in the range I chose. 
# So that I can try to find the correct number which was selected by computer.

# Acceptance Criteria:
# * Computer must randomly pick an integer from user selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer. 
# * Your program should prompt the user for guesses if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the guess is too high or too low. 
# * If the user guesses correctly, the program should print total time and total number of guesses. 
# * You must import some required modules or packages You can assume that the user will enter valid input.
